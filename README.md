The main techniqes i have used to build the foundation of the site was using css grid in a dynamic sense since it can do both collums and rows which was perfect for my concept

I tried using percentages whenever i can since they are less likely to have a reponsive issuee with a screen size

I didnt get that muc responses on my servey but one that i got is to chnage the color of the text beace it was a bit to dark with a background so I changed that.
